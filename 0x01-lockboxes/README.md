In programming, a lockbox is a conceptual model often used in puzzles or challenges to simulate a set of boxes, each containing keys to other boxes. The goal is to determine whether you can unlock all the boxes starting from a specific initial state.

## General Idea Behind Lockboxes
The main idea is to manage a collection of boxes, where each box can contain keys to other boxes. Starting with the first box (which is open), you need to check if you can eventually open all the other boxes by using the keys found within the already opened boxes.

## General Algorithm
1. **Initialize**: Start with the first box as opened.
2. **Collect Keys**: For each opened box, collect the keys it contains.
3. **Unlock Boxes**: Use the collected keys to open new boxes.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until you either:
   - Open all the boxes, or
   - No more boxes can be opened with the available keys.
5. **Check**: If all boxes are opened, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

## How the Python Program (0-lockboxes.py) Works
The `0-lockboxes.py` script implements the described algorithm to solve the lockboxes puzzle.

### Function: `look_next_opened_box`
- **Purpose**: To find the next box that is opened but not yet checked.
- **Parameters**: `opened_boxes` - a dictionary representing the opened boxes.
- **Returns**: The list of keys contained in the next box to be checked.

### Function: `canUnlockAll`
- **Purpose**: To determine if all boxes can be unlocked.
- **Parameters**: `boxes` - a list where each element is a list of keys contained in that box.
- **Returns**: `True` if all boxes can be opened, `False` otherwise.

### Function: `main`
- **Purpose**: Entry point of the script.
- **Functionality**: Calls `canUnlockAll` with an example input to demonstrate functionality.

### Example Code Explanation
Here's a detailed explanation of the provided code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - If the list of boxes is empty or contains only one box, return `True` immediately as all boxes can be considered unlocked.
   
2. **First Box Handling**:
   - The first box (index 0) is initialized as opened.
   
3. **Key Collection and Box Unlocking**:
   - Use `look_next_opened_box` to get the keys from the next opened box.
   - For each key, try to unlock the corresponding box.
   - Mark the box as opened and add the keys it contains to the auxiliary dictionary `aux`.
   
4. **Termination**:
   - If no more boxes can be opened and not all boxes are opened, return `False`.
   - If all boxes are opened, return `True`.

### Running the Script
The `main` function demonstrates how to use `canUnlockAll`. When executed, the script will check if all boxes in the provided list can be unlocked.

To run the script, save it as `0-lockboxes.py` and execute it in a Python environment:
```sh
python3 0-lockboxes.py
```

This script is designed to solve the lockboxes puzzle by iterating through the boxes, collecting keys, and opening new boxes until all possible boxes are opened or no more boxes can be unlocked.
