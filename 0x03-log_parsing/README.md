*Welcome to the "0x03. Log Parsing" project! In this task, you'll combine your Python programming skills with real-time data processing. You'll learn how to effectively read and parse data streams from standard input (stdin), handle specific data formats, and perform calculations based on that data. Through this project, you'll explore key concepts like log parsing, data processing, and signal handling, all of which are essential for managing and analyzing logs in a dynamic environment.*

## What is Log Parsing?

**Log parsing** is like going through a big diary, where each page is filled with information about events or actions that happened over time. Imagine you're looking for specific events, like whenever your favorite song played on the radio. You'd scan the pages to find and note every instance of that song. Similarly, in computing, log parsing is the process of scanning logs (detailed records of activities) to find and extract specific information, such as errors or user actions.

## What is Log Parsing Used For?

Log parsing helps in understanding what happened in a system, just like how reading through a diary helps you understand what happened in someone's day. It's used to:
- **Monitor System Health**: Identify issues or unusual activities.
- **Debugging**: Find out what went wrong when an error occurred.
- **Compliance**: Ensure that systems are behaving according to regulations.
- **Security**: Detect unauthorized access or security breaches.

## Are There Alternatives to Log Parsing?

Yes, there are alternatives! Some systems might use tools that automatically monitor and alert about issues without needing to manually parse logs. These tools might visualize data or use AI to predict and prevent problems. However, log parsing is still valuable for detailed, customized analysis.

## Concepts Needed

### File I/O in Python

**File I/O (Input/Output)** is like reading and writing notes in a notebook. When we read from `sys.stdin`, it's like listening to someone speak, and we're writing down everything they say, line by line.

- **Python Input and Output**: In Python, you can read data from files or even real-time input, like getting a stream of messages. This helps in processing data as it comes in.

### Signal Handling in Python

Imagine you're having a conversation, and someone suddenly shouts "STOP!" (like pressing `CTRL + C`). You need to know how to politely end the conversation without leaving it awkwardly. That's what **signal handling** does in Python—it gracefully handles interruptions.

- **Python Signal Handling**: This is how Python knows what to do if you suddenly tell it to stop running a program, ensuring it finishes things up neatly.

### Data Processing

**Data processing** is like sorting through a bunch of letters to find and organize specific ones based on their content.

- **Parsing Strings**: This means breaking down a piece of text to find specific information, like finding all the names in a letter.
- **Aggregating Data**: After collecting pieces of information, you summarize them, like counting how many letters mention a specific topic.

### Regular Expressions

**Regular Expressions (Regex)** are like using a special magnifying glass to find specific patterns in text, such as looking for dates written in a specific format.

- **Python Regular Expressions**: They allow you to search through text and find specific patterns, ensuring the data you're working with fits a certain structure.

### Dictionaries in Python

**Dictionaries** in Python are like labeled jars where you store different kinds of candies (data). Each jar (key) has a label, and inside it, you count how many candies of that type you have.

- **Python Dictionaries**: These are used to store data in pairs (like "status code": "count"), making it easy to look up how many times something occurred.

### Exception Handling

**Exception Handling** is like having a safety net when you're performing a tricky move, like jumping from a high place. If something goes wrong, the net catches you, and you can try again or end safely.

- **Python Exceptions**: These are tools in Python that help your program not crash if something unexpected happens, like trying to read a file that doesn’t exist. Instead, it gives you a chance to fix the problem or end the process smoothly.
