# README: Minimum Operations Problem

## Introduction

The Minimum Operations problem requires finding the least number of operations to achieve a target number of characters on a notepad, starting with one character, using only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste." This problem can be approached using various algorithmic and mathematical concepts, including Dynamic Programming, Prime Factorization, Code Optimization, and Greedy Algorithms.

## Problem Statement

Given a number `n`, determine the minimum number of operations required to obtain exactly `n` characters on the notepad. The allowed operations are:
1. **Copy All**: Copy all the characters on the notepad.
2. **Paste**: Paste the copied characters.

### Example

For `n = 3`:
1. Copy All (1 operation)
2. Paste (2 characters, 2 operations)
3. Paste (3 characters, 3 operations)

Total operations: 3.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and building up the solution incrementally. In the context of the Minimum Operations problem, DP can be used to store the minimum number of operations needed to reach each number of characters, thereby avoiding redundant calculations.

### 2. Prime Factorization

Prime Factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. For the Minimum Operations problem, understanding the prime factorization of `n` helps determine the number of operations. Specifically, the minimum number of operations is related to the sum of the prime factors of `n`.

### 3. Code Optimization

Optimizing code involves making it run faster or use fewer resources. For this problem, efficient code is crucial due to the potentially large value of `n`. Optimization techniques include minimizing the number of operations and using efficient data structures.

### 4. Greedy Algorithms

A Greedy Algorithm makes a series of choices by selecting the best option available at each step. For the Minimum Operations problem, this approach might involve always opting for the "Copy All" operation whenever a new factor is encountered.

### 5. Basic Python Programming

Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary to implement the solution effectively.

## Implementation

### Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations required to achieve `i` characters.
   - Initialize `dp[1] = 0` (no operations needed to have 1 character).
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, find the minimum `dp[j] + i/j` for all `j` that divide `i`.

2. **Prime Factorization**:
   - Factorize `n` into its prime factors.
   - Sum the prime factors to find the minimum number of operations.

### Example Code

```python
def min_operations(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = i  # Maximum operations (all Paste)
        for j in range(1, int(i ** 0.5) + 1):
            if i % j == 0:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + i // j)
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i // j] + j)
    return dp[n]

n = 3
print(f"Minimum operations to reach {n} characters: {min_operations(n)}")
```

## Conclusion

The Minimum Operations problem is an excellent exercise for practicing algorithmic and mathematical skills, particularly in Dynamic Programming, Prime Factorization, and optimization techniques. By understanding these concepts, one can devise an efficient solution to minimize the number of operations needed to reach a target number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.
